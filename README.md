# ECON511-FinalProject-Passport-Costs
This repository contains R code performing comprehensive regression analysis on a dataset covering the costs of passports, most observations collected from 2004-05. The code attempts to perform robust analysis, create several possible regression models, and select the best one based on different regression conditions and relative explanatory power. The goal was to develop a consistent explanatory model for different passport prices across 125 countries.
